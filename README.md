# Language Detection with LSTMs
By: Adam Lieberman, Ravish Chawla, & Garrett Mallory 

Note: We had spoken with Dr. Gardner about working in a group of 3, which he approved. 

The Blog containing background information on LSTMs and a walkthrough of our code can be found at:

5. js 
	
	- contains the javascript for the blog 


6. data 
	
	- contains the data used in the code 
	- A subdirectory called Langauges contains the data    	for the extra credit portion of our project. Please   	place data at the approproate level if needed.

8. project2.pdf
	
	- a pdf version of our blog (please use the link to the blog as style is preserved there)

	
### To Run the code

The Python packages in `requirements.txt` need to be installed with pip before continuing. We use Python 3.5 with this project. To run the code, you can open the IPython Notebooks and run the cells sequentially.

Because of high computational cost of the LSTM, a machine with a GPU is recommended.
